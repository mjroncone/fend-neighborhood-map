# Front End Neighborhood Map (P5)
=================================

##TODO:
=======

1. Introduce Error-handling
  * **Google Maps API** DONE!
  * **FourSquare API** DONE!

2. Introduce more responsive design
  * **Sliding List View:** add media query that hides the list view below certain pixels, with a hamburger menu and animation to bring it out. When item in list is clicked, hide menu and highlight marker.
  * **Text adjust:** have text adjust size based on screen size.
  * **Auto-adjust zoom:** write function that determines proper map zoom based on screen size.

3. Use gulp to automate build.

4. Actually populate this README with the necessary information.
